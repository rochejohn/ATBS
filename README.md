# Automate The Boring Stuff Projects


>Template In Progress

> Below are my Python Scripts for each  Chapter Project.
> Each with a GIF to show functionality.

> At the end of each chapter are multiple projects with no available solutions, which encourages students to create their own code.

> Automate The Boring Stuff is a free book written by Al Sweigart for learning Python 3.
